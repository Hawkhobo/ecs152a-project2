1) Should extensively use Chrome DevTools and/or MITMproxy to monitor traffic to the Root DNS Server. Can validate if our DNS query
successfully sent with these tools! Wireshark is good too, but MITMproxy is more robust.

2) Constructing DNS Request. See format in book, and make sure to refer to RFC 1034 and RFC 1035! Need to construct this DNS query 
byte-by-byte, and make sure it hits the appropriate Root DNS Server (we'll have to test a few from the list, for sure)

3) Keep in mind that Root DNS Server is not the end of it. Implicated in the Part I text, but if it is an Iterative traversal, we'll be
receiving intermediate DNS responses (and sending out intermediate DNS queries) until we finall get the IP from the authoritative DNS 
server for tmz.com...

4) Build HTTP request using format given in text, refer to RFC 1945 if more particulars are needed. HTTP request not specified. Just a GET?

5) ALL with the Socket library in Python. Get familiar with it's docs, examples, so on and so forth. Will help with plugging through syntax.

6) Will be measuring RTT's. Might be simple as importing Time again for recv() call [or whatever the equivalent is]. Keep an eye out if 
Socket has some analytical tools for this.
